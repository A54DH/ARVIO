## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Critical Security**

Goal: Remove hardcoded API keys from source code and fix SSL configuration.

Requirements:
- SEC-01: API keys stored in BuildConfig via Secrets Gradle Plugin
- SEC-02: API keys protected with provider restrictions
- SEC-04: SSL validation uses NetworkSecurityConfig
- SEC-05: Comprehensive .gitignore prevents secrets from version control

Status: Not started - needs planning
